# Fraud-Detection
* Dataset can be found out on : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
* The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. 
* The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
* Classification Models were performing well with more than 99% accuracy but this neglected the minority class i.e. detecting fraud transaction which is of major concern.
* Performed SMOTE on train dataset to deal with class imbalanced data.
* Compared different models on the basis of precision and recall concerning minority class and selected the best.
